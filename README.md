### Project Overview
---
The ["Car Sales Analytics"](https://1drv.ms/u/c/53d9d0eaf14ddcbb/EdwOVC7Nn_hHjCUCDwkeqn8BusPdoTorbG1ZlUcdwk_Jng?e=jptPO3) Power BI project is designed to deliver a clear, interactive, and data-driven view of a car dealership’s sales performance. By pulling together data from various sources, this project provides meaningful insights into the dealership’s operations — from tracking vehicle sales trends to analyzing customer behavior and sales team performance.
Through intuitive dashboards and visuals, stakeholders can explore patterns, identify growth opportunities, and make well-informed strategic decisions. Whether it's understanding which car models are top sellers, evaluating the performance of different branches, or forecasting future sales, this solution brings valuable business intelligence to the table.
